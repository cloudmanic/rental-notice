# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build and Development

-   **PHP Development**: `php artisan serve` - Run Laravel server
-   **Frontend**: `npm run dev` - Run Vite for frontend assets
-   **All-in-one**: `composer dev` - Runs server, queue, logs, and Vite

## Tests

-   **Run All Tests**: `php artisan test` or `./vendor/bin/phpunit`
-   **Run Single Test**: `php artisan test --filter=TestName`
-   **Run Test Suite**: `php artisan test --testsuite=Unit`

## Code Style and Conventions

-   **PHP Linting**: `./vendor/bin/pint` - Laravel Pint
-   **Framework**: Laravel 11 with Livewire 3.5
-   **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS
-   **Naming Conventions**:
    -   Models: PascalCase singular (e.g., `Tenant.php`)
    -   Controllers: PascalCase with Controller suffix
    -   Livewire components: Grouped by feature (Notices, Tenants, etc.)
    -   Test methods: snake_case describing functionality
-   **File Organization**: Feature-based structure
-   **Database**: Migrations, factories, and seeders
-   **Error Handling**: Use Laravel validation patterns

## Business Logic Rules

### Notice Type Filtering

-   **IMPORTANT**: When displaying notice types to users, filter by EXACT match on `notice_type_plan_date`
-   The query must use `where('plan_date', '=', $accountPlanDate)` NOT `<=` or `>=`
-   This applies to:
    -   Notice creation form (Livewire/Notices/Create.php)
    -   Notice edit form (Livewire/Notices/Edit.php)
    -   Notice type validation in both components
-   Each account has a `notice_type_plan_date` field that must exactly match the `plan_date` on notice types

## Before Committing Code

**IMPORTANT**: Always run Laravel Pint before committing to ensure code formatting standards:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pint
```

## Committing Code

-   Do not add that it was generated by claude
-   Do not add the co-author

### Code Documentation

-   **Function Comments**: We should always put comments above every function explaining what's going on. Let's use the Laravel coding standards.
